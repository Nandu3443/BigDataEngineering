### 1. **Variables and Data Types**
**Exercise:**  
Create a program that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart.  
- Define variables for the price of three items (e.g., `item1_price`, `item2_price`, `item3_price`) and their quantities.  
- Calculate the total cost and print it.

**Example:**  
```python
item1_price = 10.5
item1_quantity = 2
# Define similar variables for item2 and item3
# Calculate total cost and print
```

### 2. **Type Casting**
**Exercise:**  
Write a program that asks the user for their age as a string, converts it to an integer, and calculates the year they were born. Assume the current year is 2025.

**Example:**  
```python
# Input: "25"
# Output: "You were born in 2000."
```

---

### 3. **Input/Output**
**Exercise:**  
Create a program that asks the user for their name and favorite color, then prints a personalized greeting.

**Example:**  
```python
# Input: "Alice", "blue"
# Output: "Hello Alice! Your favorite color is blue."
```

### 4. **String Operations and Formatting**
**Exercise:**  
Write a program that takes a sentence as input and performs the following:  
- Counts the number of words.  
- Converts the sentence to uppercase.  
- Replaces all spaces with underscores.

**Example:**  
```python
# Input: "Python is fun"
# Output: "Words: 3, Uppercase: PYTHON IS FUN, Modified: Python_is_fun"
```

---

### 5. **Conditional Statements**
**Exercise:**  
Create a program that determines if a person is eligible to vote.  
- Input: Age of the person.  
- Output: "Eligible to vote" if age is 18 or above, otherwise "Not eligible."

**Example:**  
```python
# Input: 20
# Output: "Eligible to vote"
```

---

### 6. **Loops**
**Exercise 1:**  
Write a program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a `for` loop.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a program that keeps asking the user for a number until they enter a negative number. Use a `while` loop.

**Example:**  
```python
# Input: 5, 10, -1
# Output: "You entered a negative number. Exiting."
```

---

### 7. **Functions**
**Exercise 1:**  
Write a function `calculate_area` that takes the radius of a circle as input and returns its area. Use the formula `area = Ï€ * r^2`.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a function `is_palindrome` that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

**Example:**  
```python
# Input: "radar"
# Output: True
```

---

### 8. **Combining Concepts**
**Exercise:**  
Create a program that simulates a simple ATM.  
- Ask the user for a PIN (use input).  
- If the PIN is correct, display a menu with options: Check Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, Exit.  
- Use functions for each operation and loops to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.

**Example:**  
```python
# Input: "1234"
# Output: "Welcome! Choose an option: 1. Check Balance 2. Deposit 3. Withdraw 4. Exit"
```
